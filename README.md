Homework 2 - Data Collection  
Due 1/24/2025

#####################################################################################

1. Explain your data collection process.

    I have a few plants at home, so I decided to collect data from three of my houseplants: Holy Basil, Golden Pothos, and Dwarf Umbrella Tree. I researched how to measure the length and width of a leaf and then measured 30 leaves for each plant, focusing mostly on the matured leaves because they were easier to measure and represented the plant's typical leaf size. I recorded all the measurements in a table and saved them in a CSV file for further analysis.

2. What instrument did you use to collect data with?

    I used a ruler and a measuring tape to measure the length and width of the leaves. These tools allowed me to measure leaf dimensions in centimeters, which was appropriate for the size of the leaves I was working with.

3. Argue the accuracy and precision of your instrument.

    I found that the ruler and measuring tape are fairly accurate for measuring the leaf length and width. I could measure up to 0.1 cm(1 mm), which was precise enough for this assignment.
    However, since these are manual tools, there is always a slight chance of errors. To minimize those errors, I took time and patience and measured each leaf twice. Also, since I focused on mature leaves, which are easier to measure, I     believe the results are reliable overall.

4. How many data points did you collect? Why?

    I collected 90 data points in total, 30 points for each plant type. I chose this number because I think it is large enough for meaningful analysis and comparisons between the three plants. Moreover, since I was doing the measurements manually, 90 points felt like a manageable number.

5. Define the size of your data in terms of both N (full data set size) and n (each subset size).

    N (Full data set size): 90
    n (each subset size): 30

6. Explain any problems that you ran into during the data collection process.

    I faced a few challenges while collecting the data. Firstly, leaves on the same plant were sometimes very different in size because they were both young and mature. So, I decided to focus on measuring mostly mature leaves.
    For Holy Basil, I noticed that since it is winter and kept indoors, the leaves are very small and delicate. Measuring them took more time because of this.
    Measuring Golden Pothos and Dwarf Tree was also tricky because some leaves were curved or not completely flat, and I had to flatten them carefully and adjust the ruler to get accurate measurements.
    Finally, the process was a little time consuming. It took me 90 minutes to measure all 90 leaves, but I wanted to ensure accuracy and avoid damaging the plants, so I worked slowly and carefully.

Analysis:

Questions 1, 2, and 3 are answered in the HW2.py file.

4. Explain each graph in terms of variance, mean, median, and standard deviation. 

The graphs show that Holy Basil has small and similar-sized leaves, with very little difference in length and width (mean: ~2.3 cm, std dev: ~0.26 cm). Golden Pothos has bigger leaves with more differences in size (mean: ~9.9 cm, std dev: ~1.87 cm), and some leaves are much larger than others. Dwarf Umbrella Tree is in between, with medium-sized leaves and some variation (mean: ~4.58 cm, std dev: ~0.59 cm). The scatter plots show that longer leaves are also wider for all plants, with Holy Basil being the most consistent and Golden Pothos the least.


5. What can you infer with data and graphs that you have?

Holy Basil has small, consistent leaves that grow in similar proportions. Golden Pothos has larger leaves with more variation, but longer leaves are still wider. Dwarf Umbrella Tree has medium-sized leaves that are more consistent than Golden Pothos but less consistent than Holy Basil. Overall, each plant shows its own unique pattern of leaf growth.
